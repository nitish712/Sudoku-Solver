This file shows the organisation of various classes used in the program.

board.cpp:
This represents the structure of the game. It contains two 2-D arrays:
board
chance_board
board contains the value at a particular place. If none is there, it is marked as 0.
chance_board contains the possible values for that place. They are represented in a bit wise fashion. 

basic.cpp:
This contains all the basic operations that are done on the board such as setting and clearing the bits in the chance_board at a position.
It also uses an object of "board" class. 
There is also a method perform_op() which should be over-ridden by the derived classes.

Remaining all classes inherit basic.cpp and initialize the board object by calling the base class constructer. Note that the arrays in the board object are kept public for easier access.
