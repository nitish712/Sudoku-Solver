Sudoku-Solver
=============

Computer program to solve a given sudoku puzzle. You need to compile 'main.cpp' and run it. Format for the puzzle to be given as input is shown in 'board.txt'. If you want to add new method of solving create a new class with a describing name. For better understanding see the sample 'new_method.cpp' class.
However, this program fails to solve the following puzzle. I will update the code in near future to get on with this.

_ 7 _ _ 9 _ 2 _ _
_ 5 _ _ _ 7 _ _ _
